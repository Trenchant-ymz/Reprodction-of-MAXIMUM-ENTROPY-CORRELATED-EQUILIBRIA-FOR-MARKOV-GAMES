# Reprodction-of-MAXIMUM-ENTROPY-CORRELATED-EQUILIBRIA-FOR-MARKOV-GAMES
Reproduction of the Maximum Causal Entropy theory proposed by Brian in The Principle of Maximum Causal Entropy for Estimating Interacting Processes

We use the Maximum Causal Entropy theory in predicting the Correlated Equilibria for markov games. In these games, we know the utility of each play in each state. And we want to predict the rational behavior of them.
